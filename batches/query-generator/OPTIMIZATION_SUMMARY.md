# Batch Job Optimization Summary

## Problem Solved
The original batch job was calling AWS Secrets Manager for every single product processed, which is:
- **Inefficient**: Multiple unnecessary API calls
- **Expensive**: Each Secrets Manager call costs money
- **Slow**: Network latency for each product
- **Rate-limited**: Can hit Secrets Manager API limits

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Secret Caching System**
Added global caches for API keys and configurations:
```python
# Cache for API keys and configurations (fetched once per job)
_api_key_cache = None
_rds_config_cache = None
```

### 2. **Cached Access Functions**
- `get_gemini_api_key()`: Fetches Gemini API key once, reuses for entire job
- `get_rds_config()`: Fetches RDS credentials once, reuses for entire job

### 3. **Pre-initialization**
- `initialize_secrets()`: Pre-fetches all secrets at job start
- Called at the beginning of `main()` function

### 4. **Updated Core Functions**
- `generate_questions()`: Now uses cached API key instead of fetching each time
- `get_db_connection()`: Now uses cached RDS config instead of fetching each time

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization:
```
Job with 100 products:
- Secrets Manager calls: 200+ (2 per product minimum)
- Network latency: ~200ms Ã— 200 calls = 40+ seconds
- Cost: $0.05 per 10,000 calls = ~$0.001 per job
```

### After Optimization:
```
Job with 100 products:
- Secrets Manager calls: 2 (total for entire job)
- Network latency: ~200ms Ã— 2 calls = 0.4 seconds
- Cost: $0.05 per 10,000 calls = ~$0.00001 per job
```

### **Performance Gains:**
- âš¡ **99% faster** secret retrieval
- ðŸ’° **99% cheaper** Secrets Manager costs
- ðŸ”„ **No rate limiting** issues
- ðŸ“ˆ **Better scalability** for large jobs

## Code Changes Summary

### New Functions Added:
1. `get_gemini_api_key()` - Cached Gemini API key retrieval
2. `get_rds_config()` - Cached RDS configuration retrieval  
3. `initialize_secrets()` - Pre-fetch all secrets at job start

### Modified Functions:
1. `generate_questions()` - Uses cached API key
2. `get_db_connection()` - Uses cached RDS config
3. `main()` - Calls `initialize_secrets()` at start

### Benefits by Job Size:

| Products | Secrets Calls Before | Secrets Calls After | Time Saved | Cost Saved |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| 10       | ~20                 | 2                   | ~3.6s      | 90%        |
| 50       | ~100                | 2                   | ~19.6s     | 98%        |
| 100      | ~200                | 2                   | ~39.6s     | 99%        |
| 500      | ~1000               | 2                   | ~199.6s    | 99.8%      |

## Implementation Details

### Cache Behavior:
- **Scope**: Per job session (container lifetime)
- **Thread Safety**: Single-threaded batch job, no concerns
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead (~1KB per secret)
- **Expiration**: Secrets cached for entire job duration

### Error Handling:
- If secret fetch fails, job fails fast (better than partial failure)
- Cache is populated on first access or during initialization
- No retry logic needed since secrets are stable during job execution

### Backward Compatibility:
- âœ… No changes to input/output formats
- âœ… Same functionality, just optimized
- âœ… Same error handling behavior
- âœ… Same logging (with additional cache status messages)

## Usage Examples

The optimization is transparent to users. All existing commands work the same:

```bash
# Same commands, but now much faster for large jobs
./submit_batch_job.sh --job-id "test-123" --products-json '[...]'
```

### New Log Messages:
```
[INIT] Pre-fetching all secrets for caching...
[AI] Fetching Gemini API key from Secrets Manager (first time)
[DB] Fetching RDS configuration from Secrets Manager (first time)
[INIT] All secrets cached successfully in 0.45s
...
[AI] Using cached Gemini API key for model configuration
[DB] Using cached RDS credentials, connecting to host: ...
```

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators:
- Only 2 Secrets Manager calls per job (regardless of product count)
- Faster overall job execution time
- No "rate exceeded" errors from Secrets Manager

### CloudWatch Metrics to Watch:
- SecretsManager API call count should be constant (2 per job)
- Batch job execution time should decrease for large jobs
- Batch job cost should decrease proportionally

This optimization makes the batch job much more efficient and cost-effective, especially for large-scale processing jobs!
