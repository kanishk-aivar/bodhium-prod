### SQL Database Documentation, Creation, and Indexing

This document outlines the schema, purpose, and SQL commands for creating and optimizing your database tables: `scrapejobs`, `products`, `queries`, and `llmtasks`.

-----

#### 1\. `scrapejobs` Table

**Documentation üìú**
The `scrapejobs` table is designed to track individual web scraping operations. It stores metadata about each job, including its source, current status, and timestamps for creation, updates, and completion. It also captures any errors encountered.

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `job_id` | `uuid` | `NO` | `gen_random_uuid()` | **Primary Key.** Unique identifier for each scraping job. |
| `source_url` | `text` | `YES` | | The URL or starting point for the scraping job. |
| `status` | `character varying` | `YES` | | Current status of the job (e.g., 'pending', 'in\_progress', 'completed', 'failed'). |
| `created_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Timestamp when the job was initially created. |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Last timestamp when the job's record was modified. |
| `brand_name` | `character varying` | `YES` | | The brand associated with the scraping task. |
| `error_message` | `text` | `YES` | | Detailed message if the job failed. |
| `completed_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | | Timestamp when the job successfully completed. |
| `progress` | `jsonb` | `YES` | `'{}'::jsonb` | JSON object storing dynamic progress information. |

**Table Creation üõ†Ô∏è**

```sql
CREATE TABLE scrapejobs (
    job_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source_url TEXT,
    status CHARACTER VARYING,

```

**Indexing Commands ‚ö°**

```sql
-- Index on status for quickly finding jobs by their current state
CREATE INDEX idx_scrapejobs_status ON scrapejobs (status);

-- Index on created_at for chronological sorting and range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_scrapejobs_created_at ON scrapejobs (created_at);
