### SQL Database Documentation, Creation, and Indexing

This document outlines the schema, purpose, and SQL commands for creating and optimizing your database tables: `scrapejobs`, `products`, `queries`, and `llmtasks`.

-----

#### 1\. `scrapejobs` Table

**Documentation üìú**
The `scrapejobs` table is designed to track individual web scraping operations. It stores metadata about each job, including its source, current status, and timestamps for creation, updates, and completion. It also captures any errors encountered.

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `job_id` | `uuid` | `NO` | `gen_random_uuid()` | **Primary Key.** Unique identifier for each scraping job. |
| `source_url` | `text` | `YES` | | The URL or starting point for the scraping job. |
| `status` | `character varying` | `YES` | | Current status of the job (e.g., 'pending', 'in\_progress', 'completed', 'failed'). |
| `created_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Timestamp when the job was initially created. |
| `updated_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Last timestamp when the job's record was modified. |
| `brand_name` | `character varying` | `YES` | | The brand associated with the scraping task. |
| `error_message` | `text` | `YES` | | Detailed message if the job failed. |
| `completed_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | | Timestamp when the job successfully completed. |
| `progress` | `jsonb` | `YES` | `'{}'::jsonb` | JSON object storing dynamic progress information. |

**Table Creation üõ†Ô∏è**

```sql
CREATE TABLE scrapejobs (
    job_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    source_url TEXT,
    status CHARACTER VARYING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    brand_name CHARACTER VARYING,
    error_message TEXT,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    progress JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);
```

**Indexing Commands ‚ö°**

```sql
-- Index on status for quickly finding jobs by their current state
CREATE INDEX idx_scrapejobs_status ON scrapejobs (status);

-- Index on created_at for chronological sorting and range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_scrapejobs_created_at ON scrapejobs (created_at);

-- Index on brand_name for filtering jobs by specific brands
CREATE INDEX idx_scrapejobs_brand_name ON scrapejobs (brand_name);
```

#### 2\. `products` Table

**Documentation üìú**
The `products` table stores the detailed information about individual products scraped from various sources. It includes unique identifiers, raw product data, and a link back to the scraping job that discovered it.

| `product_data` | `jsonb` | `YES` | | JSON object containing the scraped product's details. |
| `source_url` | `text` | `YES` | | The URL from which the product data was scraped. |
| `first_scraped_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | `YES` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | Timestamp when the product was first scraped. |
| `brand_name` | `character varying` | `YES` | | The brand associated with this product. |
| `job_id` | `uuid` | `YES` | | **Foreign Key** referencing `scrapejobs.job_id`. Links the product to the job that found it. |

**Table Creation üõ†Ô∏è**

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS products_product_id_seq;

CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT nextval('products_product_id_seq'),
    product_hash CHARACTER VARYING,
    product_data JSONB,
    source_url TEXT,

    job_id UUID,
    CONSTRAINT fk_job
        FOREIGN KEY (job_id)
        REFERENCES scrapejobs (job_id)
        ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

**Indexing Commands ‚ö°**

```sql
-- Unique index on product_hash to ensure data integrity and fast lookups
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uix_products_product_hash ON products (product_hash);

-- Index on brand_name for filtering products by brand
CREATE INDEX idx_products_brand_name ON products (brand_name);

-- Index on job_id for efficient foreign key lookups and joins with scrapejobs
CREATE INDEX idx_products_job_id ON products (job_id);

-- Index on first_scraped_at for chronological queries
CREATE INDEX idx_products_first_scraped_at ON products (first_scraped_at);
```

#### 3\. `queries` Table

**Documentation üìú**
The `queries` table stores specific search or analysis queries related to products. This allows for tracking what queries are being run against product data and their current status.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `query_id` | `bigint` | `NO` | `nextval('queries_query_id_seq')` | **Primary Key.** Unique identifier for each query. |
